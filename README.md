# IBC Refresh

This tool automates tasks for IBC relayers, such as clearing packets and updating clients between blockchain networks. It's designed to simplify the management of IBC relayer functions through a command-line interface.

## Features

- **Automated Task Execution**: Automate the execution of tasks like `clear_packets` and `update_client` based on configurations specified in a YAML file.
- **Configurable**: Easily configurable to handle different chains and tasks using a YAML file.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of task execution results, helping in troubleshooting and monitoring the operations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- PyYAML for YAML file processing.
- Access to command line or terminal.

```yaml
log_directory: .logs/
task_log_file: task_execution.log
command_log_file: executed_commands.log
hermes_path: /home/relayer/.local/bin/hermes

tasks:
  - type: clear_packets
    entries:
      - { chain: archway-1, port: transfer, channel: channel-147, destination_chain: beezee-1 }
      - { chain: beezee-1, port: transfer, channel: channel-2, destination_chain: archway-1 }
      - { chain: beezee-1, port: transfer, channel: channel-0, destination_chain: osmosis-1 }
      - { chain: osmosis-1, port: transfer, channel: channel-340, destination_chain: beezee-1 }

  - type: update_client
